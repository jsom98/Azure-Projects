In this report I found a brute force attempt on my MS SQL server on my Windows VM

I used 2 different OSINT websites to verify that it was malicious.

Then I added the malicious IP address to be blocked at the firewall

I then closed it as true positive and left comments on what I found and did.

In this report I found another brute force attempt on my MS SQL server on my Windows VM.

But this time the IP address has not been reported so I reported it on the OSINT website to identify the emerging threat.
