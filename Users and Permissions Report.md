In this report, I will quickly show how to make users. First, go to the user's service on Azure.

This is what it looks like for me since I already have a few users

Select the New User dropdown and click Create New user

Enter the user principle name, display name, and password you want the new user to have.

You don’t have to fill the Properties tab for this report but you can have information for the user you’re creating.

In the Assignments tab, you will then click Add Role.

Then you can search and pick the role you want the user to have and click review and create.
